# Next Steps 
## 1: Sessions Draft
### Abandon
- [x] We should have an option to abandon/delete the draft.

### Player Search
- [x] A search field for the user to use to search for a player (with typeahead) 

## 2: Generate & Confirm Matches
### Court Removal
We should be able to remove courts from the generation instead of always generating matches on all courts. Do it for all by default, then let the user remove a court if required.

### Match Generation Options
- [x] The FAB should bring up the available options "Auto Generate", "Add manual"

### Generation Overrides
The FAB should also have options to generate 'types' of matchups. 
Equal - Focus on equal skill across players, either all male, all female, or mixed only
Strong - Focus on equal skill of the higher score
Players With Least Games - Focus on getting the players who have played the least on the court, skill score being the secondary

### Save as Draft
- [x] We should remove this from auto generated options and only have this available on manual creation

## 3: Match Completion
### Display
- [x] The team content should be centred to use the card size more effectively.

### Complete Match
- [x] The team card should be clickable to bring up the "Complete Match" dialogue with the selected team pre-selected as the winners.
