Next up: 

1. Score weighting should be able to be set at the club level when creating a new club.Each strategy has a number picker that must add up to 100%.

2. The club should also have a setting to set if the blacklist is "preferred" or a "hard limit. This should respected in the matching algorithm too.


3. When a match has been generated and the user is choosing to accept / change it. The user should be able to remove people and then re-run the matching algorithm (obviously not selecting. the same people who were removed.)

4. The user should be able to select a 'draft' match that has been requested so they can put these people on when available.
